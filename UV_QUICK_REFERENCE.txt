# UV Setup - Quick Reference

## What Changed?

Your notebook was using `piplite` and `micropip`, which are only for browser-based JupyterLite environments. Since you're running this locally, we've switched to using `uv` package manager for clean, reproducible dependency management.

## What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Install UV (One-time)
```powershell
pip install uv
```

### Step 2: Install Project Dependencies
```powershell
cd "d:\Data Science Project"
uv pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scipy seaborn ipywidgets tqdm jupyter ipykernel
```

**Already Done!** ✓ Dependencies have been installed.

### Step 3: Run Jupyter
```powershell
cd "d:\Data Science Project"
jupyter notebook
```

Then open: `DA0101EN-Review-Introduction.jupyterlite-20221114-1668384000.jupyterlite.ipynb`

## Files Updated

- **pyproject.toml** - Project configuration with all dependencies listed
- **DA0101EN-Review-Introduction.jupyterlite-20221114-1668384000.jupyterlite.ipynb** - Updated to use standard imports
- **UV_SETUP_GUIDE.md** - Full setup guide with troubleshooting

## Key Advantages of UV

✓ **Reproducible** - Same `pyproject.toml` = same environment everywhere  
✓ **Fast** - Lightning-fast package resolution  
✓ **Simple** - Easy to add/remove packages  
✓ **Future-proof** - Works with local Jupyter, JupyterHub, cloud notebooks, etc.

## Adding More Packages Later

Just edit `pyproject.toml` and add to the dependencies list:
```toml
dependencies = [
    "pandas>=1.3.3",
    "numpy>=1.21.2",
    "requests>=2.28.0",  # ← Add new packages here
]
```

Then reinstall:
```powershell
uv pip install -e .
```
